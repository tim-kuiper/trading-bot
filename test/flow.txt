Strategy:

Since we cant do hedging (multiple long/short positions on the same asset pair), we only go short when trend is downwards. So:

When MACD hist crossing 0 upwards:
- Buy asset


Margin call formulas on Kraken:
- Long: 
    - Equity = Trade Balance + Profit/Loss
    - Profit/Loss = % of profit or loss on already open position
    - Margin Call Price = Entry Price - ((Equity - (Used Margin x 0.8)) / Open Volume*)
    - Liquidation Price = Entry Price - ((Equity - (Used Margin x 0.4)) / Open Volume*)

- Short:
    - Margin Call Price = Leverage x (Trade Balance + (Entry Price x Open Volume)) / (Open Volume x (0.8 + Leverage))
    - Liquidation Price = Leverage x (Trade Balance + (Entry Price x Open Volume)) / (Open Volume x (0.4 + Leverage))

Stop-Loss-Limit for each long/short position:
- 8H: +- 5% from current price
- 1D: +- 10% from current price
- 1W: +- 15% from current price

If MACD hist crosses upwards:
- Open / Add long position
  - Save order TXID and corresponding SLL TXID together (the SLL needs to be closed first in order to close/reduce the position)
  - Save amount bought
