Long/Short on MACD crossover on 8H / 1D / 1W timeframes

Margin call formulas on Kraken:
- Long: 
    - Equity = Trade Balance + Profit/Loss
    - Profit/Loss = % of profit or loss on already open position
    - Margin Call Price = Entry Price - ((Equity - (Used Margin x 0.8)) / Open Volume*)
    - Liquidation Price = Entry Price - ((Equity - (Used Margin x 0.4)) / Open Volume*)

- Short:
    - Margin Call Price = Leverage x (Trade Balance + (Entry Price x Open Volume)) / (Open Volume x (0.8 + Leverage))
    - Liquidation Price = Leverage x (Trade Balance + (Entry Price x Open Volume)) / (Open Volume x (0.4 + Leverage))
